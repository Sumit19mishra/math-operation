# math-operation
Arithmetic is a traditionally used mathematical operation concerned with numeral systems and their operations. It is applied to get a definite single value. The term got originated from the Greek word “arithmos” which simply means numbers. The traditional operations associated with arithmetic include summation, difference, multiplication, and division. These operations are being carried out for the purpose of trading, marketing, and monetization for centuries.

Arithmetic is the elementary branch of mathematics that specifically deals with the study of numbers and properties of traditional operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Basic Operations in Arithmetic
The four basic operations of arithmetic i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are discussed below:

Addition (+)

The simple definition for addition will be that it is an operation to combine two or more values or numbers into a single value. The process of adding n numbers of value is called summation.

0 is said to be the identity element of addition as while adding 0 to any value it gives the same result. For example, if we add 0 to 5 the result would be the same that is 5.

0 + 5 = 5

And, the inverse element includes the addition of the opposite value. The result of adding inverse elements will be an identity element that is 0. For example, if we add 2 with its opposite value -2, then the result would be

2 + (-2) = 0

Subtraction(-)

Subtraction is the arithmetic operation that computes the difference between two values (i.e. minuend minus the subtrahend).In the condition where the minuend is greater than the subtrahend, the difference is positive. It is the inverse of addition.

4 – 2 = 2

While, if the subtrahend is greater than minuend the difference between them will be negative.

2 – 4 = -2

Multiplication(×)

The two values involved in the operation of multiplication are known as multiplicand and multiplier. It combines two values that is multiplicand and multiplier to give a single product.

The product of two values supposedly a and b is expressed in a.b or a × b form.

2 × 4 = 8

Division(÷)

The division is the operation that computes the quotient of two numbers. It is the inverse of multiplication. The two values involved in it are known as dividends by the divisor and if the quotient is more than 1 if the dividend is greater than the divisor the result would be a positive number. 

4 ÷ 2 = 2
